# The World of EcoWorld

## The Great Divergence (2030-2040)

The 2030s marked a period of unprecedented global change. What historians now call "The Great Divergence" began with a series of cascading crises: climate disasters, resource wars, and technological disruptions that collectively shattered the old international order.

As traditional power structures collapsed, nation-states fragmented along cultural, economic, and ideological lines. The era of superpowers gave way to a more diverse global landscape with hundreds of independent nations, each seeking to carve out their path in a chaotic world.

## The New Foundations (2040-2050)

From the ashes of the old order, new political entities emerged. Some were built around resource-rich territories, others around technological centers, and still others around cultural or religious identities. What they shared was a fierce commitment to independence in a world without overarching authorities.

During this period, the Consortium of Sovereign Nations (CSN) was established â€“ not as a global government but as a minimal forum for resolving disputes and establishing basic rules for international engagement. Unlike its predecessors, the CSN was designed with limited powers, respecting the hard-won sovereignty of its member states.

## The Current Era (2050-Present)

Today's world is characterized by dynamic competition and cooperation between nations of vastly different sizes, resources, and ideologies. Without dominant superpowers to impose order, international relations have become more fluid, with shifting alliances and rivalries creating a complex geopolitical landscape.

Technology has advanced in unexpected ways, diverging along different paths as nations prioritized solutions to their particular challenges. Some focused on biotechnology to address food security, others on energy independence, and still others on military technology for defense in an uncertain world.

The global economy has become more regionalized, with trading blocs forming around geographical proximity and resource complementarity. While global trade continues, nations place greater emphasis on self-sufficiency in critical sectors, a lesson learned from the supply chain collapses of the Great Divergence.

The past decade has been relatively peaceful compared to the chaos of the Great Divergence, but tensions are rising as nations compete for dwindling resources and strategic advantage. Many observers fear that the world stands at another inflection point, where today's rivalries could transform into tomorrow's conflicts.

As a leader of a newly-established nation, you enter this world of opportunity and peril. Your decisions will not only shape the destiny of your people but could influence the trajectory of this new global era.
